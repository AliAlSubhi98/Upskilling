        **Repository Initialization:**
        ```bash
        $ git init
        Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/alialsubhi/Desktop/Upskilling/.git/
        
        $ git status
        On branch main
        No commits yet
        nothing to commit (create/copy files and "git add" to track)
        ```
        
        **Basic File Operations:**
        ```bash
        $ echo "Hello World" > README.md
        $ git add README.md
        $ git commit -m "Initial commit: Add README"

        ```
        
        **Branching Basics:**
        ```bash
        $ git checkout -b feature/new-feature
        Switched to a new branch 'feature/new-feature'
        
        $ git branch
        * feature/new-feature
          main

        **Feature Branch Creation:**
        ```bash
        $ git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
        Switched to a new branch 'feature/user-authentication'
        
        $ git branch -a
        * feature/user-authentication
          main
        ```
        
        **Merge Conflict Resolution:**
        ```bash
        $ git merge main
        Auto-merging UserAuth.java
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in UserAuth.java
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
        
        $ git status
        On branch feature/user-authentication
        You have unmerged paths.
          (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
          (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
        
        Unmerged paths:
          (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
                both modified:   UserAuth.java
        ```
        
        **Cherry-Pick Operations:**
        ```bash
        $ git log --oneline main
        a1b2c3d Add user authentication
        b2c3d4e Add password validation
        c3d4e5f Add session management
        
        $ git cherry-pick b2c3d4e
        [feature/user-authentication d4e5f6g] Add password validation
        1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)
        ```
        
        **Rebase vs Merge:**
        ```bash
        # Rebase (cleaner history)
        $ git rebase main
        First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
        Applying: Add user authentication
        Applying: Add password validation
        
        # Merge (preserves branch context)
        $ git merge feature/user-authentication
        Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
         UserAuth.java | 45 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
         1 file changed, 45 insertions(+)
        ```

## Personal Notes

??? info "Note #1: Level 2 ‚Äì Branching & Merging (26-07-2025)"
    To achieve **Level 2: Branching & Merging**, I followed these steps:

    **1. Create a feature branch**
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/advanced-branching
    ```

    **2. Make changes and commit**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update Git-GitHub.md with Level 2 notes"
    ```

    **3. Rebase onto `main`**
    ```bash
    # Switch to main
    git checkout main

    # Pull the latest changes
    git pull origin main

    # Switch back to your feature branch
    git checkout feature/advanced-branching

    # Rebase onto latest main
    git rebase main
    ```

    **4. Push the branch and create a Pull Request**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/advanced-branching
    ```

    **5. Merge Pull Request**
    ```bash
    - Open your PR on GitHub
    - Click "Merge pull request"
    - Confirm with "Confirm merge"
    - Optionally click "Delete branch"
    ```

??? info "Note #2: Level 2 ‚Äì Merge Conflict Resolution (27-07-2025)"
    **Exercise Overview:** Practiced resolving complex merge conflicts across multiple file sections.

    **Scenario Created:**
    - Created conflicting changes in `practice-file.md` across multiple sections
    - Main branch: Production configuration (MySQL, enhanced features)
    - Feature branch: Development configuration (PostgreSQL, basic features)

    **Resolution Process:**
    ```bash
    # 1. Attempt merge (creates conflict)
    git merge main
    # Output: CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in practice-file.md

    # 2. Examine conflict markers
    # <<<<<<< HEAD (current branch)
    # ======= (separator)
    # >>>>>>> main (incoming branch)

    # 3. Resolve by combining best of both versions
    # - Combined introduction text
    # - Added both production and development configurations
    # - Merged feature lists
    # - Created comprehensive notes section

    # 4. Complete the merge
    git add practice-file.md
    git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts: combine dev and production features"
    ```

    **Skills Practiced:**
    ```bash
    - Understanding conflict markers
    - Strategic conflict resolution (combining vs. choosing)
    - Maintaining clean repository after practice
    - Professional merge commit messages
    ```

    **Key Learnings:**
    ```bash
    - Complex conflicts can be resolved by combining both versions intelligently
    - Always clean up practice files to keep repository organized
    - Document the resolution strategy in commit messages
    ```

??? info "Note #3: Level 2 ‚Äì Cherry-Pick Practice (04-08-2025)"
    **Exercise Overview:** Successfully practiced selective commit application using git cherry-pick.

    **Scenario Created:**
    - Created feature branch with 3 different features:
      - UserAuth.java (user authentication)
      - PaymentProcessor.java (payment processing)
      - NotificationService.java (notification service)
    - Each feature committed separately for selective picking

    **Cherry-Pick Process:**
    ```bash
    # 1. Created feature branch with multiple commits
    git checkout -b feature/user-authentication
    # Added UserAuth.java, PaymentProcessor.java, NotificationService.java

    # 2. Switched back to main branch
    git checkout main

    # 3. Cherry-picked specific commits
    git cherry-pick 12827b6  # Payment processing feature
    git cherry-pick c1de365  # User authentication feature
    git cherry-pick 75ecc57  # Notification service feature
    ```

    **Skills Practiced:**
    ```bash
    - Understanding commit hashes and their purpose
    - Selective commit application across branches
    - Managing multiple features in separate commits
    - Verifying cherry-pick results
    ```

    **Key Learnings:**
    ```bash
    - Cherry-pick creates new commit IDs while preserving changes
    - Useful for applying hotfixes or specific features to different branches
    - Maintains clean commit history by selecting only needed changes
    - Essential skill for advanced Git workflows and release management
    ```

??? info "Note #4: Level 3 ‚Äì Commit History & Recovery (26-10-2025)"
    **Exercise Overview:** Mastered advanced Git recovery techniques and commit history management.

    **Skills Demonstrated:**
    ```bash
    # Git Reflog - Recover lost commits
    git reflog                    # View all commit history
    git reset --hard <commit>    # Recover lost commits
    
    # Git Bisect - Find bugs systematically
    git bisect start             # Start bisect session
    git bisect bad HEAD          # Mark current commit as bad
    git bisect good <commit>     # Mark known good commit
    git bisect run ./test.sh     # Automatically test commits
    
    # Git Reset - Safe recovery
    git reset --soft HEAD~1     # Undo commit, keep changes staged
    git reset --mixed HEAD~1    # Undo commit, keep changes unstaged
    git reset --hard HEAD~1     # Undo commit, discard changes
    
    # Git Revert - Safe undo
    git revert HEAD              # Create new commit that undoes last commit
    git revert <commit>         # Revert specific commit
    
    # Git Tagging - Release management
    git tag v1.0.0              # Create lightweight tag
    git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release" # Create annotated tag
    git push origin --tags      # Push tags to remote
    ```

    **Key Achievements:**
    - **Commit Recovery**: Mastered git reflog for recovering lost commits
    - **Bug Finding**: Used git bisect to systematically find bug introduction points
    - **Safe Recovery**: Practiced different types of git reset for various scenarios
    - **Release Management**: Created and managed version tags for releases
    - **Advanced Techniques**: Recovered from accidental deletions and branch issues
