# Observability

**Goal:** Gain complete visibility into system health using logs, metrics, and traces.

**Current Level:** Level 1

---

## Level 1: Monitoring & Logging Basics
- **Competencies:** Log Analysis, Metrics Collection, Understanding Alerts
- **Tools:** Log Files, Syslog, journalctl, top, htop
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Collect logs from a running application using journalctl or tail -f
  - [ ] Use htop or top to monitor real-time system performance
  - [ ] Configure basic alerts for server uptime

## Level 2: Advanced Logging & Metrics Collection
- **Competencies:** Centralized Logging, Structured Logs, Metrics Dashboards
- **Tools:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Prometheus, Fluentd
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Set up an ELK Stack and aggregate logs from multiple sources
  - [ ] Create a Prometheus-based metrics dashboard
  - [ ] Implement structured logging with JSON

## Level 3: Distributed Tracing & Centralized Monitoring
- **Competencies:** OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, Log Aggregation, Alerting
- **Tools:** OpenTelemetry (Otel), Jaeger, Grafana, Loki
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Integrate Jaeger for distributed tracing in a microservices system
  - [ ] Set up Grafana with Loki for real-time log visualization
  - [ ] Configure log aggregation across multiple services

## Level 4: Full Observability Stack & Incident Response
- **Competencies:** Service Health, Tracing Pipelines, SLA Monitoring
- **Tools:** PagerDuty, Sentry, OpenTracing, Prometheus Alerts, Thanos
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Implement a full observability stack with tracing, logs, and metrics
  - [ ] Configure alerts with Prometheus & PagerDuty
  - [ ] Handle a live incident and create a postmortem report

## Level 5: Enterprise Observability & AI-Based Monitoring
- **Competencies:** Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection, Large-Scale Tracing, Automated Infrastructure Health
- **Tools:** AI-Based Anomaly Detection, Kubernetes Observability, Cortex, New Relic, Datadog
- **Checklist:**
  - [ ] Automate log analysis using AI-based anomaly detection
  - [ ] Deploy observability for a large-scale Kubernetes cluster
  - [ ] Implement self-healing infrastructure monitoring
