# Code + Design Patterns

**Goal:** Write clean, idiomatic, and performant code, and guide architecture decisions through patterns and standards.

**Current Level:** Level 1

---

## Level 1: Core Programming & Concurrency
- **Competencies:**
  - Master language features and syntax
  - Apply arrays, maps, trees, graphs, sorting/searching
  - Write idiomatic, concurrent code
  - Use goroutines, async/await, threads effectively
- **Outcomes:**
  - Solve real-world problems using standard data structures
  - Use built-in concurrency primitives
  - Follow language idioms
- **Challenges:**
  - Avoiding race conditions
  - Mapping theory to practical problems
  - Managing shared memory and goroutine/thread lifecycles

## Level 2: Data Structures & Code Organization
- **Competencies:**
  - Use design patterns to solve recurring problems
  - Write clean, modular, and scalable code
  - Organize code by responsibility (feature/domain/layered)
- **Outcomes:**
  - Apply SOLID principles
  - Use separation of concerns
  - Favor composition over inheritance
- **Challenges:**
  - Avoiding over-abstracting
  - Maintaining simplicity while scaling
  - Teaching and enforcing architecture standards

## Level 3: Advanced Algorithms & Problem Solving
- **Competencies:**
  - Solve LeetCode Medium+ problems
  - Use recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking
  - Optimize space/time complexity under constraints
- **Outcomes:**
  - Break down complex problems
  - Write clear, performant solutions
  - Communicate thought process effectively
- **Challenges:**
  - Balancing readability with optimization
  - Debugging under time pressure
  - Recognizing algorithmic patterns

## Level 4: Technical Leadership & Codebase Stewardship
- **Competencies:**
  - Lead complex refactors
  - Mentor across code quality, design, and scalability
  - Set code standards and enforce architecture discipline
- **Outcomes:**
  - Provide effective reviews
  - Advocate pattern reuse and clean abstractions
  - Coach others on decision trade-offs
- **Challenges:**
  - Balancing team autonomy with consistency
  - Aligning tech direction with business goals
  - Building team confidence through code mentoring
