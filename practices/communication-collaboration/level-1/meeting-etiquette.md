- **Lighting:** Face well-lit, avoid backlighting, natural light preferred
- **Background:** Clean, professional, or use virtual background

- **Personal space:** Respect others' personal space and comfort

### **Speaking Guidelines**

#### **When You Want to Speak:**
1. **Wait for a natural pause**
2. **Use a clear signal** (raise hand, say "Excuse me")
3. **Be acknowledged** before starting
4. **Speak clearly** and at appropriate volume
5. **Stay on topic** and be concise

#### **When Speaking:**

- **Provide context** if needed
- **Use examples** to illustrate your point
- **Ask for feedback** if appropriate
- **Respect time limits** for your contributions

#### **Example of Good Meeting Contribution:**
```
"I'd like to add to the discussion about the authentication issue. 
Based on my experience with similar problems, I think we should 
check the database connection first. I've seen this error pattern 
before and it's usually a connection timeout. 
Would you like me to investigate this angle?"
```

### 👂 **Listening Guidelines**

#### **Show You're Listening:**
- **Nod occasionally** to show engagement
- **Make eye contact** with the speaker
- **Take notes** on important points
- **Ask clarifying questions** when appropriate
- **Avoid interrupting** unless urgent

#### **When Someone Else is Speaking:**
- **Don't multitask** (checking email, texting)
- **Don't prepare your response** while they're talking
- **Don't interrupt** unless it's urgent
- **Don't have side conversations**
- **Do take notes** on key points

## Meeting Types & Specific Etiquette

### **Daily Standups**

#### **Your Turn to Speak:**
```
"Yesterday I completed the security headers implementation and 
tested the input validation. Today I'll focus on rate limiting 
configuration. I need help from the DevOps team to set up Redis. 
No blockers currently."
```

#### **When Others Speak:**
- **Listen actively** to understand their work and challenges
- **Take notes** on dependencies and potential collaboration opportunities
- **Offer help** if you can assist with their tasks
- **Ask clarifying questions** if needed for understanding
- **Respect time limits** (usually 1-2 minutes per person)
- **Avoid side conversations** during others' updates

#### **Standup Best Practices:**
- **Be specific** about accomplishments and next steps
- **Identify blockers** honestly and ask for help when needed
- **Keep updates concise** and focused on the team's goals
- **Listen for opportunities** to collaborate or assist others
- **Follow up** on any commitments or help offered

### **Project Planning Meetings**

#### **Contributing Ideas:**
- **Build on others' ideas** before presenting new ones
- **Use data and examples** to support your points
- **Ask questions** to clarify requirements and constraints
- **Suggest alternatives** when appropriate
- **Be open to feedback** and different perspectives
- **Consider implementation feasibility** and resource requirements

#### **Example Contribution:**
```
"I like Sarah's approach to the authentication flow. 
Building on that, I think we should also consider 
implementing rate limiting from the start. 
This would prevent brute force attacks and give us 
better security posture. What do you think about 
adding that to the initial implementation?"
```

#### **Planning Meeting Best Practices:**
- **Come prepared** with research and data
- **Listen to all perspectives** before forming opinions
- **Ask clarifying questions** to understand requirements
- **Suggest realistic timelines** and resource needs

- **Follow up** on any commitments made

### 🐛 **Problem-Solving Meetings**

#### **When Discussing Issues:**

- **Provide specific examples** and evidence
- **Suggest solutions**, not just complaints
- **Be open to different approaches**
- **Ask questions** to understand the full scope
- **Consider root causes** before jumping to solutions

#### **Example Problem Discussion:**
```
"I've been seeing authentication failures in production 
since the last deployment. The error rate is about 15% 
and it's affecting user login. I've checked the logs 
and it seems to be related to the JWT token validation. 
I think we should rollback to the previous version 
while we investigate. What's everyone's thoughts on this approach?"
```

#### **Problem-Solving Best Practices:**
- **Define the problem clearly** before discussing solutions
- **Gather all relevant information** and perspectives
- **Consider multiple solutions** before deciding
- **Evaluate pros and cons** of each approach
- **Assign clear ownership** for next steps
- **Set follow-up meetings** if needed for complex issues

### **Code Review Meetings**

#### **Giving Feedback:**
- **Start with positives** - acknowledge good work
- **Be specific** about issues and suggestions
- **Provide examples** of better approaches
- **Ask questions** to understand the reasoning
- **Suggest improvements**, don't just criticize
- **Focus on code quality** and maintainability

#### **Example Code Review Feedback:**
```
"Great implementation of the security headers! I really 
like how you've organized the configuration. 

I have a couple of suggestions:
1. Consider extracting the hardcoded values to a config file
2. The error handling could be more specific
3. Maybe add some unit tests for the edge cases

Here's an example of what I'm thinking:
[provide specific code example]

Overall, solid work! These changes would make it more maintainable."
```

#### **Code Review Best Practices:**
- **Review code thoroughly** before the meeting
