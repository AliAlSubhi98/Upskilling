```bash
./scripts/security-assessment.sh headers
```

## Rate Limiting
Redis-based rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks.

### Configuration
[Include configuration details]

### Testing

## Advanced Collaboration Scenarios & Responses

### Scenario 1: Asking for Help

#### **Poor Request:**
```
"I need help with something. Can someone help me?"
```

#### **Good Request:**
```
"Hi team, I'm working on the rate limiting implementation and I'm stuck on the Redis configuration. 

I've tried:
- Setting up Redis connection
- Configuring the rate limiter
- Testing with the assessment script

The issue is that the rate limiter isn't working as expected. I'm getting connection timeouts.

Can someone with Redis experience help me troubleshoot this? I'm available for a quick call or can share my screen.

Thanks!"
```

#### **Advanced Help Request:**
```
"Hi team, I'm working on the rate limiting implementation and I'm stuck on the Redis configuration. 

**Context:** I'm implementing rate limiting for our authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

**What I've tried:**
- Setting up Redis connection with the provided configuration
- Configuring the rate limiter with 10 requests per minute
- Testing with the security assessment script

**The issue:** The rate limiter isn't working as expected. I'm getting connection timeouts when trying to connect to Redis.

**Error details:** 
- Connection timeout after 5 seconds
- Redis is running on localhost:6379
- No authentication required

**What I need:**
- Help troubleshooting the Redis connection
- Review of my rate limiting configuration
- Best practices for production deployment

**Availability:** I'm available for a quick call or can share my screen. I can also provide my current configuration if that would be helpful.

Thanks for any assistance!"
```

### Scenario 2: Offering Help

#### **Good Offer:**
```
"I see you're working on the authentication flow. I've implemented something similar before and might be able to help. 

Would you like me to:
- Review your current implementation?
- Share some code examples?
- Pair program on the tricky parts?

Let me know what would be most helpful!"
```

#### **Advanced Help Offer:**
```
"I see you're working on the authentication flow. I've implemented something similar before and might be able to help. 

**My experience:** I've worked with JWT authentication, OAuth2, and Spring Security in previous projects. I've also dealt with rate limiting and security headers.

**What I can offer:**
- Code review of your current implementation
- Sharing specific code examples and patterns
- Pair programming on the tricky parts
- Troubleshooting specific issues
- Best practices for security and performance

**My availability:** I'm free this afternoon for a quick call or can pair program for an hour. I can also review your code and provide detailed feedback.

**What would be most helpful for you?** I'm happy to adapt my approach based on what you need most.

Let me know what works best for you!"
```

### Scenario 3: Sharing Knowledge

#### **Good Knowledge Sharing:**
```
"Hey team, I just learned something interesting about security headers that might be useful for everyone:

The Content-Security-Policy header can be tricky to configure correctly. I found that using 'unsafe-inline' for scripts can create security vulnerabilities.

Here's a safer approach:
```javascript
// Instead of unsafe-inline
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'
```

I've updated our implementation to use this approach. Let me know if you want me to explain more or if you have questions!"
```

#### **Advanced Knowledge Sharing:**
```
"Hey team, I just learned something interesting about security headers that might be useful for everyone:

**The Problem:** The Content-Security-Policy header can be tricky to configure correctly. I found that using 'unsafe-inline' for scripts can create security vulnerabilities, even though it's convenient.

**The Solution:** Here's a safer approach that I've implemented:
```javascript
// Instead of unsafe-inline
script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'
```

**Why This Matters:** This approach provides better security by preventing inline script execution while still allowing necessary scripts to run.

**Implementation Details:** I've updated our implementation to use this approach and it's working well. The security assessment shows improved scores.

**What I Can Help With:**
- Explain the implementation in more detail
- Help you implement this in your projects
- Share the specific configuration we used
- Answer any questions about the approach

**Resources:** I've also found some great documentation on this topic that I can share.

Let me know if you want me to explain more or if you have questions!"
```

### Scenario 4: Giving Feedback

#### **Constructive Feedback:**
```
"Great work on the API documentation! I really like how you've structured it.

A couple of suggestions that might make it even better:
1. The authentication section could use an example of a real request
2. The error codes section might benefit from more specific error messages
3. Consider adding a troubleshooting section for common issues

Here's an example of what I'm thinking:
[provide specific example]

Overall, really solid work! These additions would make it even more helpful for the team."
```

#### **Advanced Feedback:**
```
"Great work on the API documentation! I really like how you've structured it and the level of detail you've included.

**What I really like:**
- Clear structure and organization
- Good use of examples and code snippets
- Comprehensive coverage of all endpoints
- Professional formatting and presentation

**Suggestions for improvement:**
1. **Authentication section:** Could use an example of a real request with actual headers and response
2. **Error codes section:** Might benefit from more specific error messages and troubleshooting steps
3. **Troubleshooting section:** Consider adding a section for common issues and solutions

**Specific examples:**
Here's what I'm thinking for the authentication section:
```javascript
// Example request with headers
const response = await fetch('/api/users', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + token,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});
```

**Impact:** These additions would make the documentation even more helpful for the team and reduce support requests.

**Next steps:** I'm happy to help implement these suggestions or review any changes you make.

Overall, really solid work! This is exactly the kind of documentation that helps the whole team succeed."
```

### Scenario 5: Resolving Conflicts

#### **Professional Conflict Resolution:**
```
"I understand we have different approaches to the authentication implementation. Let me share my perspective and then I'd like to hear yours.

My approach focuses on security first, which might make the initial implementation more complex but provides better long-term protection.

I'm curious about your approach - what are the main benefits you see? Maybe we can find a way to combine the best of both approaches?

I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for everyone."
```

#### **Advanced Conflict Resolution:**
```
"I understand we have different approaches to the authentication implementation. Let me share my perspective and then I'd like to hear yours.

**My approach focuses on security first:**
- Implement comprehensive security headers from the start
- Use JWT with proper expiration and refresh tokens
- Add rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- This might make the initial implementation more complex but provides better long-term protection

**I'm curious about your approach:**
- What are the main benefits you see in your approach?
- How does it address security concerns?
- What are the performance implications?
- How does it handle edge cases?

**Finding common ground:**
Maybe we can find a way to combine the best of both approaches? I'm open to:
- Discussing the trade-offs of each approach
- Finding a middle ground that works for everyone
- Implementing a phased approach that starts simple and adds security features
- Getting input from other team members or security experts

**Next steps:**
I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for everyone. Would you like to schedule some time to dive deeper into this, or should we get input from the rest of the team?"
```
