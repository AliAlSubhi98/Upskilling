```

**Good Documentation:**
```
# User Management API

## Authentication
All endpoints require Bearer token authentication.

## Endpoints

### GET /api/users
Retrieves list of all users.

**Headers:**
- Authorization: Bearer <token>

**Response:**
```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "isActive": true
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status Codes:**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive header coverage
- Good separation of concerns
- Clear configuration

**Suggestions:**
1. Consider extracting hardcoded values to configuration
2. Add unit tests for edge cases
3. Document the security implications

**Specific Changes:**
```java
// Instead of hardcoded values
response.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", "DENY");

// Consider:
response.setHeader("X-Frame-Options", frameOptionsPolicy);
```

Overall, solid work! These changes will make it more maintainable.
```

### Feedback Best Practices:

## Advanced Communication Exercises

### Exercise 6: Cross-Functional Communication

#### Scenario: Explaining Technical Issues to Non-Technical Stakeholders
You need to explain a database performance issue to the product manager and business stakeholders.

**Poor Communication:**
```
The database is slow because of inefficient queries and missing indexes. 
We need to optimize the SQL and add proper indexing.
```

**Good Communication:**
```
**Business Impact:** User experience is degraded due to slow page load times
**Root Cause:** Database queries are taking longer than expected
**User Impact:** 30% of users experiencing 5+ second load times
**Business Impact:** Potential revenue loss due to user frustration

**Technical Details:**
- Database queries are inefficient due to missing indexes
- Some queries are scanning entire tables instead of using indexes
- This is causing increased response times and server load

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add database indexes to improve query performance
- Optimize slow queries to reduce response times
- Implement monitoring to prevent future issues

**Timeline:** 2-3 days for implementation and testing
**Expected Outcome:** 80% improvement in page load times
```

### Exercise 7: Active Listening and Collaboration

#### Scenario: Team Problem-Solving Session
You're in a meeting where the team is discussing a complex technical challenge.

**Active Listening Techniques:**
1. **Pay full attention** - Focus on the speaker, avoid distractions
2. **Show engagement** - Nod, make eye contact, use encouraging phrases
3. **Ask clarifying questions** - "Can you help me understand...", "What I'm hearing is..."
4. **Paraphrase to confirm** - "So you're saying that...", "If I understand correctly..."
5. **Provide thoughtful responses** - Build on others' ideas, ask follow-up questions

**Example Active Listening:**
```
Teammate: "I think we should use Redis for caching, but I'm concerned about the memory usage."

You: "I understand you're considering Redis for caching but worried about memory consumption. 
Can you help me understand what specific memory concerns you have? Are you thinking about 
cost implications or performance impact?"

Teammate: "Both, actually. Redis can be memory-intensive, and we're already close to our 
server limits."

You: "That's a valid concern. What if we explored Redis with memory optimization settings, 
or would you prefer to look at alternative caching solutions that might be more memory-efficient?"
```

### Exercise 8: Knowledge Sharing and Mentoring

#### Scenario: Onboarding a New Team Member
You need to help a new developer understand your team's development process and tools.

**Knowledge Sharing Best Practices:**
1. **Start with context** - Why this knowledge matters, how it fits into the bigger picture
2. **Use examples** - Real scenarios, not just abstract concepts
3. **Provide hands-on practice** - Let them try it themselves
4. **Check understanding** - Ask questions, have them explain back
5. **Offer ongoing support** - Make yourself available for questions

**Example Knowledge Sharing:**
```
"Let me walk you through our development process. We use Git Flow for branching, 
which means we have main, develop, and feature branches. Here's why this matters: 
it helps us maintain stable code while allowing parallel development.

Let me show you with a real example. When we started the security implementation, 
I created a feature branch like this: [demonstrates git commands]. 

Now, let's practice this together. I'll guide you through creating your first 
feature branch for the authentication work. Don't worry if you make mistakes - 
that's how we all learn!"
```
